# Portfolio
Repo containing all of Marco Tabacman's coding projects
Projects ending in 4 number codes are projects completed for U of Minn CSCI classes of the same code

Descriptions / how to run:

[kmeans1913](https://github.com/MarcoTab/Portfolio/tree/kmeans1913): Implements the k-means algorithm to simplify the colors of an image. Uses specialized image format, so examples are included. K = # of colors.
            Run run_k_means.py (Python).
            
[evenodd1913](https://github.com/MarcoTab/Portfolio/tree/evenodd1913): Implements several simple ciphers to learn about polymorphism. Includes simple demonstration of the end product.
             Run FinalDecoding.java (Java).
             
[gibberisher1913](https://github.com/MarcoTab/Portfolio/tree/gibberisher1913): Implements a 26 leaf per level tree (+ other data structures) to create legible  gibberish english words.
                 Run GibberisherMain.java (Java).

[banlet&treemap2011](https://github.com/MarcoTab/Portfolio/tree/banlet%26treemap2011): Creates a banner based on input text.
                    Run 'make' then banlet_main (C).
                    
[thermo2011](https://github.com/MarcoTab/Portfolio/tree/thermo2011): Implements a simple thermometer, used to learn bit shifting and masking.
            Run 'make' then thermo_main (C).
            
[thermov2_2011](https://github.com/MarcoTab/Portfolio/tree/thermov2_2011): Implements same thermometer, but the thermo_update functionality is in Assembly.
               Run 'make' then thermo_main (C and AT&T x86_64).
               
[optims2011](https://github.com/MarcoTab/Portfolio/tree/optims2011): Implements optimizations for the matrix squaring problem. Implements a benchmark for several array search algorithms.
            Run 'make' then matsquare_benchmark or search_benchmark.
